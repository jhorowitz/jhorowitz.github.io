I know almost nothing about deep learning but from what little I do know,
I can already tell that I love it.

I've made it my goal to learn everything I can about machine learning.
I barely remember basic calculus so I have a lot to catch up on. I'll be
chronicling my educational journey on this blog. I hope that It'll serve as
both a set of notes for me and a guide for others who want to embark on a
similar journey.

As I make progress I'll update this post.
